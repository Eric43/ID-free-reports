# ID-free-reports
A basic repository for free infectious disease tracking reports and R code.

### This is a work in progress and is subject to change and spell/grammar check at any time! :)

## To use

Just download/copy the:

state_ID_report.Rmd 

Edit the <INSERT STATE HERE> with the correct state (without the <>).  Check the states stay in place/lockdown order and correct the date if necessary.  The data set is downloaded from the NY-times data and the rest the entire file can be run and knit(ed) to the correct final format.  Enjoy.


The goal of this is to help hospitals with limited resources to develop their own Infectious Disease reports.  The intial work is based upon the COVID-19 timesereis work.  However, it will also include geospatial and other helpful tools for anyone to use without a need for developing an new report framework.  

This work is insired in part by all the medical professional on the front-line of the COVID-19 epidemic and creating a free and open system for ID tracking in a World Health Organization type of model.  It is thought that minimizing the cost for epidemology reports, statisticians and consultants that more money can be spent on treatment and protective equipment.

Initial submissions to this repository will center around the United States of America but will then expand as needed to other areas of the world.


## Sections of the report

The report is currently broken down into basic sections:  1. Time series analysis of the data, 2.  Analysis/Linear modeling of before/after time frames to look at case progression over a 2 week window and 3. Geo-spatial modeling on a county level to look at overall distrubution of the disease.


As per the reports this is a GPLv3 program with CC-BY-SA report
